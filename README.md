## Description

Do you find it difficult to remember every album you want to listen to while browsing Rate Your Music? Are you tired of your bookmarks being clogged with Rate Your Music links? Well, here's a solution.

If you are an avid user of Rate Your Music, you have certainly run into the issue of managing your backlog.

With BackLog, you can sort your albums with beautiful cover art, filter by specified criteria, and head directly to the RateYourMusic page to read reviews and rate the album!
