# BackLog - A RateYourMusic Tool

BackLog allows users to store and organize albums they want to listen to within an extension.

## Description

Do you find it difficult to remember every album you want to listen to while browsing RateYourMusic? Are you tired of your bookmarks being clogged with RateYourMusic links? Well, here's a solution.

If you are an avid user of RateYourMusic, you have certainly run into the issue of managing your backlog. Managing and tracking your backlog can be overwhelming and time consuming, and RateYourMusic lacks a way to easily catagorize music you would like to eventually listen to. BackLog is here to solve this issue. 

BackLog will allow you to store the albums you want to listen to in an extension, freeing your bookmarks bar from unnecessary links.
